//Define a function, myIncludes, that accepts an array and a searchValue as arguments.

//myIncludes should return true if the searchValue is an element in the array. Otherwise, 
//myIncludes should return false.

//Do not use the built-in .includes array method during this problem. Feel free to use it 
//on any future problem though! Note that strings have an .includes method, too.

//myIncludes([10, 20, 30], 20); // => true
//myIncludes(['apples', 'bananas', 'citrus'], 'pears'); // => false
